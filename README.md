# Automated Weather Data Processing and Analytics Platform 

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates an Automated Weather Data Processing and Analytics Platform utilizing AWS services, Terraform, Python, Docker, and Jenkins for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). It aims to provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for real-time weather data ingestion, processing, and visualization.

### Key Components & Technologies

- **AWS Services**: Utilizing Lambda, RDS (PostgreSQL), S3, EC2, IAM, and CloudWatch for a robust, scalable cloud environment.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **Python**: For writing Lambda functions that process weather data.
- **Docker**: For containerizing Python applications and Jenkins environment.
- **Jenkins**: For automating build, test, and deployment pipelines.
- **Git/GitHub**: For source control and versioning.

### Architecture

1. **AWS S3 Bucket**: Stores raw weather data in JSON format.
2. **AWS Lambda Functions**: Triggers on new data in S3, processes it, and stores it in RDS.
3. **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**: Hosts the database for structured weather data storage.
4. **AWS EC2 Instances**: Host Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines and serve as a Bastion Host for secure access.
5. **VPC, Subnets, Security Groups**: Ensure network security and isolation.

### Detailed Workflow

#### Initial Setup

- Source code is maintained in GitHub.
- AWS CLI and Terraform are set up for cloud resource provisioning.
- Dockerfiles are prepared for Python and Jenkins environments.

#### Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

- Scripts provision S3 for data storage, RDS for PostgreSQL database, Lambda functions for data processing, EC2 instances for Jenkins and Bastion Host, and necessary security configurations.

#### Application Containerization (Docker)

- Python application and Jenkins are containerized to ensure consistent environments.

#### CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)

- Automates testing, building Docker images, pushing to AWS ECR, and deploying Lambda functions.

#### Python Application Development

- Lambda functions process incoming weather data, transforming and storing it in the RDS database.

#### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Unit tests for Python scripts.
- Code quality checks integrated into Jenkins pipelines.

#### Monitoring (AWS CloudWatch)

- Monitors key metrics and sets up alerts for system health and performance.

#### Optional Web Dashboard

- A front-end application for visualizing weather data analytics (if implemented).

### Security & Best Practices

- IAM roles and policies strictly control access to AWS services.
- Security groups and subnets provide network isolation.
- Sensitive data is managed using environment variables and AWS Secrets Manager.
- The entire infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform for easy, consistent, and repeatable deployments.
- Regular commits to GitHub with documented changes for version control.
- Monitoring and alerts set up to promptly address any issues.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account and CLI configured.
- Terraform and Docker installed.
- Access to Jenkins (either local or hosted).

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**: Access all Terraform and application code.
2. **Terraform Initialization**: Run `terraform init` to prepare your working directory.
3. **Terraform Plan & Apply**: Execute `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to launch resources.
4. **Docker Build**: Build Docker images for Python applications.
5. **Jenkins Configuration**: Set up pipelines using `Jenkinsfile` in the repository.
6. **Monitor and Maintain**: Regularly check system performance, logs, and AWS billing.

## Deliverables

- Terraform configuration files for AWS setup.
- Python scripts for data processing with unit tests.
- Dockerfiles for Python application and Jenkins.
- Jenkins pipeline configurations (`Jenkinsfile`).
- Optional web application code and Dockerfile.
- Comprehensive documentation for setup and operation.

## Additional Notes

- Commit changes regularly to GitHub for version control.
- Test locally before pushing to production.
- Monitor AWS Free Tier limits to avoid unexpected charges.
- Secure sensitive information and regularly review IAM permissions.

## Conclusion

This project showcases comprehensive cloud engineering skills, including AWS service utilization, IaC, CI/CD processes, containerization, and adherence to security best practices. It demonstrates a real-world application of processing and analyzing weather data efficiently and effectively on the cloud.
